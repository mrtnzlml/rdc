# CLAUDE.md

Project-specific instructions for working in this repo.

## CI templates

- The CI template under `templates/` (`gitlab-ci.yml`) must **pin to the latest
  released rdc version** — keep `RDC_VERSION` set to the newest release tag, and
  bump it whenever a new release ships. Never a floating alias (no
  `releases/latest/...`, no unpinned tag).
- The repo is private, so the template installs rdc through
  `api.github.com/repos/<repo>/releases/assets/<id>` (resolved from the tag).
  The `releases/download/<tag>/<asset>` browser URL 404s even with a token —
  don't "simplify" the install back to it.

## Customer confidentiality

- Never put customer names or customer-specific identifiers — org/division/region
  codes, real environment names, queue/engine/hook slugs, hostnames, URLs, or file
  paths — anywhere in this repository. This covers source, tests, docs, and
  fixtures **and git commit messages/descriptions** (history, not just the working
  tree). Use neutral placeholders instead (e.g. `acme`, `main`, `invoices`,
  `test`/`dev`/`prod`, `dev-eu`/`dev-us`). If customer-specific strings ever land,
  scrub them from both the file content and the commit history.
